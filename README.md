Get your listing to the top of eBay search results!

## About
Script that adds to the "Watch" counter of a specified eBay listing in an attempt to make the listing more popular, increasing the number of real visitors that see the listing, which in turn helps the listing appear higher in search results and also makes the product appear as though it's in high-demand since it has a lot of "Watchers". Simply put, an SEO tool for eBay listings.

## Requirements
